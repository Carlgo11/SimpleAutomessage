# Config for SimpleAutoMessage
# SimpleAutoMessage is a Bukkit-plugin, developed by Carlgo11.

# COLORS:
# When adding colors use the minecraft colorcodes.
# Example: &a = green, &d = purple.

# When this config.yml is broken it's often because of the msg strings! ALWAYS USE '' AROUND A MESSAGE!
# Example: msg1: 'This is an example'
# If your config isn't working use a yaml parser or contact us on IRC.

# Don't change the version! If the version is changed this config.yml will be deleted!
version: 1.0.7
